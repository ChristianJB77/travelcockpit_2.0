# Travel Cockpit 2.0
#### Full Stack Web Developer CAPSTONE PROJECT
To finally be able to deploy my own web app, I took this Nanondegree. Based on my CS50 final project Flask app 'Travel Cockpit', I have rebuild the entire app to finally deploy it for desktop and mobile usage. As well added a travel suggestion blog functionality to share our personal 'travel secrets'.

## Purpose
As passionate travelers my wife and me were continuously looking for a central
Travel Cockpit to get all essential information necessary to plan a trip in one
tool or view. To avoid the tedious googling for each source and forgetting
always at least one important info.
Then especially in COVID-19 times it was waste of time to prepare long time
planned trips.
As nothing similar is existing, I have developed a Travel Cockpit, which makes
a spontaneous trip planning easy and efficient.
